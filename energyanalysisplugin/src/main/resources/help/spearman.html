<b>Spearman Correlation</b>
<br /><br />

Spearman rank correlation is a non-parametric test used to measure the degree of association between two variables. It was developed by Spearman; thus it is called the Spearman rank correlation. Spearman rank correlation test does not make any assumptions about the distribution of the data and is the appropriate correlation analysis when the variables are measured on a scale that is at least ordinal level.

Fun Fact! Correlation is a widely used term in statistics. In fact, it entered the English language in 1561, 200 years before most of the modern statistic tests were discovered. It is derived from the [same] Latin word correlation, which means relation.

<b>Correlation Coefficient (r):</b> Ranges from -1 to 1; describes to the strength of the relationship between the variables.

<b>Critical Value:</b> The minimum value at which an observed correlation coefficient is statistically significant.

<b>Effect Size:</b> The strength of the relationship.

<b>Ordinal Data:</b> Ordinal scales rank order the items that are being measured to indicate if they possess more, less, or the same amount of the variable being measured. An ordinal scale allows us to determine if X > Y, Y > X, or if X = Y.

<b>p-value:</b> The probability of obtaining the observed results if the null hypothesis is true. A result is usually considered statistically significant if the p-value is â‰¤ .05.

<b>Data Analysis</b>
<br /><br />
ASpearman rank correlation will be conducted to assess if a relationship exists between 2 variables. A Spearman rank correlation is the appropriate analysis when one or both variables are ordinal, but it can be used with scale variables. The correlation is a bivariate measure of association (or strength) of the relationship between two variables, and the magnitude of that relationship. The Spearman rank correlation assumes that the variables have a monotonic relationship with each other (Conover & Iman, 1981). A monotonic association means that the relationship between the variables does not change direction. This assumption will be violated if the relationship between the variables shifts from positive to negative or vice versa. The assumption of monotonicity will be assessed graphically with a scatterplot.

Correlation coefficients, rs, vary from 0 (no relationship) to 1 (perfect linear relationship) or -1 (perfect negative linear relationship). Positive coefficients indicate a direct relationship, indicating that as one variable increases, the other variable also increases. Negative correlation coefficients indicate an indirect relationship, indicating that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases. Cohen's standard will be used to evaluate the correlation coefficient, where 0.10 to .29 represents a weak association between the two variables, 0.30 to 0.49 represents a moderate association, and 0.50 or larger represents a strong association (Cohen, 1988).
