<b> PEARSON CORRELATION </b>
<br /><br />
<b>Data Analysis</b>
<br /><br />
 Pearson product-moment r correlation will be conducted to assess the relationship between 2 variables. Pearson r correlation is a bivariate measure of association (strength) of the relationship between two variables. Pearson correlation analysis assumes that the variables have a linear relationship with each other (Conover & Iman, 1981). The assumption of linearity will be assessed graphically with a scatterplot. Given that the variables are continuous (interval/ratio data), the assumption of linearity is met, and the hypotheses seek to assess the relationships, or how the distribution of the z scores vary, a Pearson r correlation is the appropriate bivariate statistic.
<br /><br />
Correlation coefficients, r, vary from 0 (no relationship) to 1 (perfect linear relationship) or -1 (perfect negative linear relationship). Positive coefficients indicate a direct relationship, indicating that as one variable increases, the other variable also increases. Negative correlation coefficients indicate an indirect relationship, indicating that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases. Cohen's standard will be used to evaluate the correlation coefficient, where 0.10 to .29 represents a weak association between the two variables, 0.30 to 0.49 represents a moderate association, and 0.50 or larger represents a strong association (Cohen, 1988).
