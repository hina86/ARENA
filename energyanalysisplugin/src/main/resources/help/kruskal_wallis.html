<b>Kruskal Wallis</b>
<br /><br />
The Kruskal-Wallis test is a nonparametric test and is used when the assumptions of ANOVA are not met.
 The tests both assess for significant differences on a continuous dependent variable by a grouping independent variable (with three or more groups).
 In the ANOVA, we assume that distribution of each group is normally distributed and there is approximately equal variance on the scores for each group. However, in the Kruskal-Wallis Test, these assumptions are omitted. Like all non-parametric tests, the Kruskal-Wallis Test is not as powerful as the ANOVA.
<br /><br />
Fun Fact! One of the creators of the Kruskal Wallis test, Allen Wallis, also served as presidential advisor to Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Ronald Reagan.

<b>Chi-Square Test Statistic (χ2):</b> Used with the df to compute the p-value.
<br /><br />
<b>Critical Difference:</b> The minimum value at which an observed difference is considered statistically significant.
<br /><br />
<b>Degrees of Freedom (df):</b> Used with χ2 to compute the p-value.
<br /><br />
<b>Mean Rank:</b> The average rank of the data for that group once the data is sorted and ranked.
<br /><br />
<b>Observed Difference:</b> The average rank of the variable once the data is sorted and ranked low to high.
<br /><br />
<b>p-value:</b> The probability of obtaining the observed results if the null hypothesis (no relationship between the independent variable(s) and dependent variable) is true; in most social science research, a result is considered statistically significant if this value is ≤ .05.
<br /><br />
<b>Post-hoc.</b> 
Since the overall test was significant, pairwise comparisons were examined between each level of Weight. The results of the multiple comparisons indicated significant differences between the following variable pairs: Underweight-Average, Underweight-Overweight, and Average-Overweight. Table 2 presents the results of the pairwise comparisons.
<br /><br />
<b>Note.</b><br /> Observed Differences > Critical Differences indicate significance at the p < .05 level.
