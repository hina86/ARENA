<b>Data Analysis</b>
<br /><br />
An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) will be conducted to determine if there a significant difference on the dependent variable by independent variable. An ANOVA is an appropriate statistical analysis when the purpose of research is to assess if mean differences exist on one continuous dependent variable by an independent variable with two or more discrete groups.
<br /><br />
The assumptions of normality, homogeneity of variance, and outliers will be assessed. Normality assumes that residuals of the ANOVA follow a normal distribution (bell-shaped curve). Normality will be assessed graphically using a Q-Q scatterplot (Field, 2013; Bates, Mächler, Bolker, & Walker, 2014; DeCarlo, 1997). Homoscedasticity assumes that there is no underlying relationship between the residuals and the fitted values. The assumption will be examined with a scatterplot of the residuals and the fitted values (Field, 2013; Bates et al., 2014; Osborne & Walters, 2002). Outliers will be determined as any observation that has a studentized residual (Field, 2013; Stevens, 2009) that exceeds the .999 quantile of a t-distribution, with the degrees of freedom being n-1, where n is the sample size.
<br /><br />
The ANOVA will apply the F-test to determine if there are any significant differences at a significance level, α = .05. If there are any significant effects, Tukey pairwise comparisons will be conducted to further examine the results.
