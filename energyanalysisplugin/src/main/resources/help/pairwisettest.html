<b> PAIRWISE T-TEST </b>
<br /><br />
<b>Research Question and Hypothesis: </b>
<br /><br />
RQ: Is there a statistically significant difference on dependent variable by independent variable?
Ho: There is not a statistically significant difference on dependent variable by independent variable.
Ha: There is a statistically significant difference on dependent variable by independent variable.

<b>Data Analysis</b>
<br /><br />
To examine the research question, a dependent sample t-test will be conducted to examine if mean differences exist between dependent variable 1 and dependent variable 2. Dependent sample t-test for paired means is an appropriate statistical analysis if each of the two samples can be matched on a particular characteristic or to examine the effects of a given measurement over time.
<br /><br />
The assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance will be assessed. The dependent samples test of correlated mean differences assumes a normal distribution or a curve that is bell shaped and symmetrical. The assumption of normality will be examined with a one-sample Shapiro-Wilk test (Razali & Wah, 2011). The paired samples t-test also assumes homogeneity of variances on the difference between both samples. To test this assumption, a Levene's test for equality of variance will be conducted (Levene, 1960). If the Levene's test for equal variance indicates that equal variances cannot be assumed (p < .05), a Welch's t-test will be used instead of the Student's t-test, which is more reliable when the two samples have unequal variances (Ruxton, 2006). The t-test will be two-tailed with the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true set at p < 0.05. This ensures a 95% certainty that the differences did not occur by chance.
