ARENA (Analyzing eneRgy Efficiency in aNdroid Apps) is a tool developed to assist developers and researchers in improving the energy efficiency of Android applications. Integrated as a plugin for Android Studio and IntelliJ IDEs, ARENA automates the energy measurement and analysis process, providing actionable insights into the energy impact of code changes and third-party libraries. This tool emerged from research focused on evaluating the energy impact of various code smell refactorings and third-party libraries used in Android apps, aiming to promote greener software engineering practices.  #energy-efficiency, #Android-development, #profiling-tool, #Android
